## My name is Jacob and I am a full-stack developer in the making. 

For 15 years I worked in the food-service industry making my way up 
to high-end bartending and management. 2020 seemed like the perfect 
opportunity to start a new career and training to be a developer with 
DigitalCrafts was the perfect choice for me.

In addition to being a musician, I am an avid rock climber, 
yogi, and outdoor adventurer. If it's out there waiting to be explored, 
I'm here to find it.
